      <h1>Install the kit</h1>

      <h2>Download the kit</h2>

      <p>The simplest way to get the kit is to <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-prototype-kit/archive/master.zip" data-link="download">download it as a zip</a>.</p>
    
      <p>Each new prototype you make will need a new copy. This will prevent prototypes from interfering with one another.</p>

      <h2>Where to keep your prototypes</h2>

      <p>We recommend keeping all your prototypes in one folder called <code>projects</code>.</p>

      <h3>Mac users</h3>
      <p>Create a folder called projects in your home folder. You can open your home folder by opening a new finder window, and selecting <code>Go > Home</code> from the top menu.</p>

      <h3>Windows users</h3>
      
      <p>Create a folder called projects in your Documents folder.</p>

      <h3>Unzip the kit and move it</h3>

      <p>Unzip the kit you downloaded - you should end up with a folder called <code>nhsuk-prototype-kit</code>.</p>

      <p>Rename the folder to something descriptive for your prototype. For this guide, weâ€™ll use <code>find-a-pharmacy</code>.</p>

      <p>Move the folder into your projects folder.</p>

      <h2>Open your prototype</h2>

      <p>Open Visual Studio Code and select <code>File > Open</code> and then locate your project in your projects folder.</p>

      <h2>Install kit dependencies (node modules)</h2>
 
      <p>Before you can run the kit, you need to download some extra code.</p>
      
      <p>Enter in the terminal:</p>

      <pre><code>npm install</code></pre>

      <img class="nhspk-img-guide" alt="Screenshot of installing node modules" src="/images/docs/npm-install.gif" />
      
      <p>The install may take up to a minute. Whilst installing it may <code>WARN</code> about some items - this is ok. As long as there are no <code>ERRORs</code> you can continue.</p>
