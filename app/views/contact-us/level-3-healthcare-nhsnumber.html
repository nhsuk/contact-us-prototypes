        I would like to request my NHS number
      </h1>
      <p>The NHS website team can help with questions and feedback about the website. But we can’t provide personal medical information such as your NHS number.</p>
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">How do I find out what my NHS number is?</h2>
      <p>When you register with a GP, you’ll be given a letter with an NHS number on it.</p>
      <p>Your NHS number should be on any letters you’ve had from the NHS.</p>
      <p>Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>prescriptions</li>
        <li>test results</li>
        <li>hospital referral letters</li>
        <li>appointment letters</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you cannot find your NHS number, ask your GP practice to help you.</p>
      <p>To protect your privacy, they may ask to see some identification (ID) such as</p>
      <ul>
        <li>your passport</li>
        <li>driving licence</li>
        <li>other proof of identity</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">If you’re not registered with a GP practice</h2>
      <p>You need to go to your local GP practice to register for an NHS number.</p>
      <p>Find your <a href="/Service-Search/GP/LocationSearch/4">local GP practice</a></p>
      <p>You don't need to have or know your NHS number to receive care. But having an NHS number helps healthcare staff and service providers know who you are and match your details to your <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/about-the-nhs/your-health-records/">health records</a>.</p>
